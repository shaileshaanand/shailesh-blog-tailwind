# Setting Default Browser in Linux Terminal

Using `xdg`

1. Install `xdg-utils`

   - On Debian based systems, you can install `xdg-utils` with

     ```bash
     sudo apt install xdg-utils
     ```

   - On Arch based systems, you can install `xdg-utils` with

     ```bash
      sudo pacman -S xdg-utils
     ```

2. Set Default Browser

   ```bash
   xdg-settings set default-web-browser firefox.desktop
   ```

   Replace `firefox.desktop` with the name of your browser's desktop file.

   - You can list all available browsers with

     ```bash
     ls /usr/share/applications/*.desktop
     ```

   - To search for a specific browser, use the `grep` command.

     ```bash
     ls /usr/share/applications/*.desktop | grep -i firefox
     ```

     Replace `firefox` with the name of your browser.
